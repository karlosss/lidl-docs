*LearnShell Input-Describing Language* (abbreviated as *LI-DL*) is a language created for the *LearnShell* project. It serves for describing the format of the input data for testing the correctness of students' submissions.

To understand what exactly *LI-DL* does, the workflow of correcting a submission must be explained. Each problem has a reference solution and a few tests defined. The strategy of correction is that the tests are executed one by one until a test fails, in which case the correction is terminated.

Executing a test means to generate input data, run separately the reference and the submitted script and then compare the results. The input data is a Bash script which takes care of creating all the necessary files, running the script with certain arguments and so on. The Bash script is generated by a Python script. The Python script is quite difficult and annoying to write. And this is the place where *LI-DL* comes into play. The *LI-DL* code is compiled into the Python script which then upon run yields a Bash script, which actually generates all the input structures.
